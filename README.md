1. Reading both the data files and joining the dataframes to present collated data.
2. Plotting certain variables to easily visualize data and understand the relationship between variables, as to which variables are positively correlated and which are negatively correlated.
3. Plotting scatter plots and box plots to understand the spread and distribution of data for certain categories (Also, it gives us an understanding that whether there are any outliers in the data or not.
4. There is also an analysis on as to what factors contribute to more Kudos/Likesüëç
